# About

This is project in order to assesss your skills with AngularJS, D3js and Zurb Foundation.
Please follow the install instructions and then run the project with "gulp", then you 
can go to http://localhost:8000/ and follow the instructions for all four tasks:
  * dashboard - Zurb Foundation HTML/CSS stuff
  * pie, lines, bars - AngularJS and D3js stuff

Please do not spend too much time - just do as much as you are comfortable with. 
If you need more time or you must charge me for this type of work, 
please let me know, and we can work out some fixed price.

There is also a PDF with all the screens listed in "readme.pdf"
